      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I started my journey in Electrical Engineering early last year, but this year I made a
        decision to fully pursue Software Development at Moringa School where I learned a lot and
        discovered my passion. Since then I have been dedicated to mastering full-stack development
        and building real-world projects that solve real world problems and deliver meaningful
        digital experiences.
      </p>

        What drives me is transforming code into functional, well-designed websites and apps that
        solve problems and enhance user experience. I view debugging as a valuable part of the
        learning process—each challenge deepens my understanding and sharpens my skills. My goal is
        to continue refining my craft and developing high-quality, efficient, and user-centered web
        applications.
